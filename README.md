# Traffic-Sign-Classification

In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. Namely, you will use TensorFlow to train a model so it can classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Dataset. After the model is trained, you will then test your model program on new images of traffic signs you find on the web, or, if you're feeling adventurous pictures of traffic signs you find locally!
